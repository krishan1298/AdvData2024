# Advanced Data Analytics Project

## About my Project

My project is about online gaming. The dataset contains a plethora of data, such as age, gender location, number of play time hours, and engagement level. With these columns, I can run analysis such as seeing what gender or location has the highest average play time hours, check if engagement level correlates to higher play time hours, and other useful queries.
